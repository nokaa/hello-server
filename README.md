This is a (very) simple http server that runs on port 5000 and prints `hello, world!` when opened in a browser.

Is this simple? Yes. Why make it? I occasionally need to run a simple server for testing purposes, and having this easily available is much more convenient that having to make sure I remember how to write Go (every time I write something like this I'm a little amazed that I don't have to look at docs to do it...).
